## False positive the class INBookRestaurantReservationIntentResponse is not available on watchOS
!missing-enum! INBookRestaurantReservationIntentCode not bound

## Bound with no availability information, removing them is a breaking change
## but I am not sure if they should be in WatchOS since they are from last year
## and seems that intro did not complain, also there are others INCar* that are
## explicitly available in WatchOS
## These are marked as unavailable in Xcode 10 beta 1 headers
## (and also fail monotouch-tests, but strangely not introspection).
