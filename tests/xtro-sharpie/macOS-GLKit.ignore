!missing-release-attribute-on-return-value! GLKit.GLKMesh[] GLKit.GLKMesh::FromAsset(ModelIO.MDLAsset,Foundation.NSArray&,Foundation.NSError&)'s selector's ('newMeshesFromAsset:sourceMeshes:error:') Objective-C method family ('new') indicates that the native method returns a retained object, and as such a '[return: Release]' attribute is required.
!missing-release-attribute-on-return-value! ModelIO.IMDLMeshBuffer GLKit.GLKMeshBufferAllocator::CreateBuffer(Foundation.NSData,ModelIO.MDLMeshBufferType)'s selector's ('newBufferWithData:type:') Objective-C method family ('new') indicates that the native method returns a retained object, and as such a '[return: Release]' attribute is required.
!missing-release-attribute-on-return-value! ModelIO.IMDLMeshBuffer GLKit.GLKMeshBufferAllocator::CreateBuffer(ModelIO.IMDLMeshBufferZone,Foundation.NSData,ModelIO.MDLMeshBufferType)'s selector's ('newBufferFromZone:data:type:') Objective-C method family ('new') indicates that the native method returns a retained object, and as such a '[return: Release]' attribute is required.
!missing-release-attribute-on-return-value! ModelIO.IMDLMeshBuffer GLKit.GLKMeshBufferAllocator::CreateBuffer(ModelIO.IMDLMeshBufferZone,System.nuint,ModelIO.MDLMeshBufferType)'s selector's ('newBufferFromZone:length:type:') Objective-C method family ('new') indicates that the native method returns a retained object, and as such a '[return: Release]' attribute is required.
!missing-release-attribute-on-return-value! ModelIO.IMDLMeshBuffer GLKit.GLKMeshBufferAllocator::CreateBuffer(System.nuint,ModelIO.MDLMeshBufferType)'s selector's ('newBuffer:type:') Objective-C method family ('new') indicates that the native method returns a retained object, and as such a '[return: Release]' attribute is required.
!missing-release-attribute-on-return-value!
